## Introduction
Based on the storyline of the group's game from the mid-term project, the group upgraded the game from 2-D to 3-D:

The main storyline still revolves around Otis, the knight, with a noble desire to conquer the treasure. To achieve his goal, he must navigate through a maze full of risks and dangers, with monsters waiting to attack him. After opening the blood-red door, he realizes that his dream has come true, and he will live in wealth and luxury for the rest of his life.

To smoothly navigate through the dark maze, Otis always holds a lantern in his left hand while advancing forward. In his other hand, he tries to defeat monsters to collect various weapons (guns, swords, etc.). These tools will be his powerful allies on the journey to conquer the treasure.

Note: The game is in development
